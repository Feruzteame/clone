## Be accessible
### incremental development week 3

This project is focused in how to accessible to screen users.I worked by focus of search button 
because in DuckDuckGo website search button the main part of the website.I try to accessible by using aria-label.
I think placeholder of the button is very necessary to know the screen users where they can search.
I can not say it is struggle but it needs more read to know about accessibility.It is important and you should have to do it.
 
 I find the main aim of accessibility is:
      
      1.Every body to have information through your website.
      2.Every body to visit your website.
